Across cultures, wisdom has been considered one of the most revered human qualities. Although the truly wise may seem
few and far between, empirical research examining wisdom suggests that it isn’t an exceptional trait possessed by a
small handful of bearded philosophers after all – in fact, the latest studies suggest that most of us have the ability
to make wise decisions, given the right context.

‘It appears that experiential, situational, and cultural factors are even more powerful in shaping wisdom than
previously imagined,’ says Associate Professor Igor Grossmann of the University of Waterloo in Ontario, Canada.
‘Recent empirical findings from cognitive, developmental, social, and personality psychology cumulatively suggest
that people’s ability to reason wisely varies dramatically across experiential and situational contexts. Understanding
the role of such contextual factors offers unique insights into understanding wisdom in daily life, as well as how it
 can be enhanced and taught.’
